            <p class="tab">Instrumentum psychotherapy is a divergent approach discovered by Dr. Linjo C J utilizing psychological apparatuses in psychotherapy so as to redefine the word psychotherapy itself, in to a broader concept of utilizing psychological instruments and verbal methods for behavioral change rather than talk therapy alone. </p>
    </section>
    <section id="overview">
        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p class="tab">
           Instrumentum is a Latin word meaning ‘an instrument, tool or utensil’. This innovative 
            approach combines established psychological concepts, such as neuroplasticity, learning, 
            motivation, divergent thinking, attention narrowing, distraction techniques etc. with verbal 
            treatment methods,  with the help of psychological instruments design to address behavioral 
            disorder. Unlike traditional therapies Instrumentum Psychotherapy leverages the potential of 
            psychological instruments that are typically used for assessment purposes in psychology. By 
            harnessing these instruments to facilitate therapeutic interventions, behavioral changes can be 
            more effectively induced, leading to greater treatment efficacy and long-lasting results. 
            Moreover, this therapeutic approach incorporates the expertise of engineers who collaborate 
            with psychologists to develop new instruments based on psychological principles advancement 
            in the field. Scientific research conducted in the field of Instrumentum Psychotherapy has 
            demonstrated its evidence based and rigorous approach to psychological practise. 
            Instrumentum Psychotherapy respects the established practices of verbal therapeutic method 
            while expanding upon them by integrating instrumental usage. This synergetic approach 
            enhances the depth, speed and durability of behavioral change although the initial instruments 
            used in this therapy are drawn from those already known to psychologists, ongoing 
            development efforts are yielding new instruments tailored to the specific psychological 
            principles underpinning the therapy. As this innovative approach continue to evolve, 
            Instrumentum Psychotherapy is poised to make a significant impact on the field of psychology. 
            Its incorporation of instrumental methods alongside verbal therapy techniques hold promise for 
            transforming the effectiveness and scope of psychological treatment.

        <h2>HISTORY</h2>
        <p class="tab">
            The principles of Instrumentum Psychotherapy was introduced into practice by Dr. Linjo C J 
        in 2024 march, in his book " My Studies on Psychological Instruments (Instrumentum  
        Psychotherapy)". but the initial application of the psychological instruments in clinical practice 
        was done by Dr. Linjo C J in 2007. Subsequent research is conducted on various psychological 
        instruments and their potential for improving behaviour, depending on the efficacy discovered. 
        Extensive study on various instruments and the resulting behavioural modifications led to 
        studies on pre-test and post-test design. Based on 17 years of in-depth research regarding 
        instrumental usage, the book was released in March 2024. Simultaneously, new instruments 
        based on psychological principles were created to effect behavioural change. These instruments 
        are in the final phase of launching.

        <h2>CORE PRINCIPLES</h2>
        <p>
           <b>Use of psychological instruments in psychotherapy- A Divergent Approach </b> </p> 
            <p class="tab">Psychotherapy as a treatment tool has significant role in behavioral disorder. Psychotherapy has 
            significance in producing behavioral change, but its replicability and time taken to produce 
            change is always under scrutiny. So, this Instrumentum Psychotherapy is trying to incorporate 
            different psychological concepts with the help of instruments with verbal methods so as to 
            produce better, faster and longer behavioral change. </p>   
            <p><B>Neuroplasticity through cognitive training</B></p>  
           <p class="tab"> The initially published book mainly deals with applying the known psychological instruments 
            in therapy so as to produce behavioral changes rather than the usual method of using 
            psychological instruments for asssessment. Mainly the instrument used are applied for three 
            months period. Because initial Instrumentum psychotherapeutic methods are based on 
            neuroplasticity phenomenon. </p>
            <p><B>Production of new instruments based on psychological principles </B></p>  
            <p class="tab">Sensitization, distraction, depth perception, visuo-motor coordination, responding and various other psychological concept-based instruments are used, as well as in developing process for 
            Instrumentum psychotherapy. </p>  
            <p class="tab">But these newer instruments are not based on neuroplasticity phenomenon so the 
            duration is much shorter. Based on principles of new instruments the duration varies.</p>  
           <p><B>Practicing principles</B></p> 
            <p>This method is used along with verbal psychotherapeutic method. Here the published book 
            shows how these instruments are applied in behavioral disorder.</p><br>
