# Instrumentum-Psychotherapy

## Overview

Instrumentum Psychotherapy is a divergent approach discovered by Dr. Linjo C J, utilizing psychological apparatuses in psychotherapy to redefine the concept of psychotherapy itself. This approach broadens the use of psychological instruments and verbal methods for behavioral change beyond traditional talk therapy.

## History

The principles of Instrumentum Psychotherapy were introduced by Dr. Linjo C J in March 2024, in his book *"My Studies on Psychological Instruments (Instrumentum Psychotherapy)"*. However, the initial application of psychological instruments in clinical practice dates back to 2007. Dr. Linjo C J's extensive 17-year research on instrumental usage in psychotherapy culminated in the publication of his book, which coincided with the development of new instruments based on psychological principles for behavioral change.

## Core Principles

### Use of Psychological Instruments in Psychotherapy - A Divergent Approach

Instrumentum Psychotherapy integrates psychological concepts like neuroplasticity, learning, motivation, divergent thinking, attention narrowing, and distraction techniques with verbal treatment methods. This approach leverages psychological instruments typically used for assessment to facilitate therapeutic interventions, enhancing treatment efficacy and durability.

### Neuroplasticity through Cognitive Training

The initial methods of Instrumentum Psychotherapy are based on the neuroplasticity phenomenon. Known psychological instruments are applied in therapy for a three-month period to produce behavioral changes, rather than solely for assessment purposes.

### Production of New Instruments Based on Psychological Principles

Instruments based on principles like sensitization, distraction, depth perception, visuo-motor coordination, and responding are used in Instrumentum Psychotherapy. Newer instruments, not based on neuroplasticity, are developed with varying durations depending on the principles they are based on.

### Practicing Principles

Instrumentum Psychotherapy is practiced alongside verbal psychotherapeutic methods. The published book details the application of these instruments in treating behavioral disorders. Instruments used include:

Dexterity Apparatus
Mirror Tracing
Stroop
Reaction Time Apparatus
Hand Steadiness Test
Two Point Threshold
Divided Attention
Maze Learning
Habit Interference
Combined Usage in certain Personality Disorders
Combined Usage in certain Behavioral Disorders
